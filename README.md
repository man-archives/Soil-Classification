This is a simple Android app which was developed with an objective of Classification of soil samples by the field engineers. Using [Sieve analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_analysis) data and [Atterberg Limits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atterberg_limits) for different soils, soils were classified based on different classification systems. Classification Systems used in this application were: [AASHTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AASHTO_Soil_Classification_System), [USCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Soil_Classification_System) and [ISSCS](http://nptel.ac.in/courses/105103097/web/chap3final/s6.htm).
